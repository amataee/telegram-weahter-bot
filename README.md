## How To Find The Bot
* This bot is supposed to work and be online 24/7, but if there is a problem, you can contact me on telegram: [@amataee](https://telegram.me/amataee) 🤙
1. This is the bot id -> [@WeatherAt_bot](https://telegram.me/weatherat_bot)
2. Use /help to get started!

## How To Run Your OWN Version Of Bot
* IMPORTNAT: I used tokens.txt to keep my tokens safe from leaking :) So you'll need to make a file and put your token there.
1. Install Requirements and see if there's more packages, install them.
2. You need to get a token from Telegram for your bot and also you need a app id for your api. I used OpenWeatherMap, but you can use anything you want.
3. Run weather_bot.py and you're good to go!
